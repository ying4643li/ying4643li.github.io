# Meet Your Tutor – Yixin (Anna) Li

I’m passionate about helping students conquer challenging STEM subjects. My Electrical Engineering studies give me a deep understanding of **Physics, Circuits, and Mathematics**, which I bring directly into my tutoring sessions.  

Over the years, I’ve guided students of all levels to achieve **better understanding, higher confidence, and improved exam results**.

## Tutoring Philosophy

I focus on **step-by-step explanations**, **practical problem-solving**, and **real-life examples**. Lessons are fully tailored to each student’s pace and learning style, ensuring they understand concepts deeply and can apply them confidently.
