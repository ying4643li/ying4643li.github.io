# Meet Your Tutor – Yixin (Anna) Li

I’m passionate about helping students conquer challenging STEM subjects.  
My Electrical Engineering studies give me a deep understanding of Physics, Circuits, and Mathematics, which I bring directly into my tutoring sessions.

Over the years, I’ve guided students of all levels to achieve better understanding, higher confidence, and improved exam results.

## My Teaching Philosophy

I focus on step-by-step explanations, practical problem-solving, and real-life examples.  
Lessons are fully tailored to each student’s pace and learning style, ensuring they understand concepts deeply and can apply them confidently.
